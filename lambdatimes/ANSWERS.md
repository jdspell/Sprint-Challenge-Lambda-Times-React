1. PropTypes are used to check the type that the data is being represented as. Since JS is a dynamic language and not static
  it does not have a built in type checking system. Proptypes allows us to check data to ensure that when it is being passed to 
  various components that the data is the type the component was setup to handle.

2. A life-cycle event describes where in the react lifecycle a component is. The lifecyle consists of the component being created, added to the DOM and destroyed. The events a component can be going through include mounting, updating and unmounting.

3. A higher order component increases reusability by having the ability to create components with similar functionality. A HOC is a function at heart that recieves a component and returns a component.

4. Components can be styled with a preprocessor which has a nice nesting property. Components can be styled with styled components which allow for all code influencing a component to be in one place. Or vanilla css stylesheet can be used which reduces the number of files with style in them down to one.
